title: Presentation skills improv workshop for speakers
---

<p>
  Public speaking can be scary, even more so when one is an introvert.
  However, some people make it look so simple, they use the right tone,
  the right gestures, project correctly and enunciate every word.
  This year, we offer our speaker line-up the opportunity
  to take part in a presentation skills improv workshop,
  which will be taught by Jill Frutkin of the Engaging Educator.</p>

<p>
  In this workshop, Jill will walk our speakers through presentation skills
  essential to being a more interesting speaker.
  They will practice activities, work on breathing, learn warm-ups,
  build confidence, address that fear of public speaking,
  and learn how to be a better presenter.</p>

<p>
  We appreciate that our attendees are willing to give up
  a summer Saturday to be with us, and this is just another way that
  we are working to make GORUCO the best tech conference in New York City.</p>
