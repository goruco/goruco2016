<p>
  This year we are offering discounted tickets
  for those who identify as belonging to
  a group that is underrepresented in the technology industry.</p>

<h3>Why offer a discount at all?</h3>

<p>
  GORUCO's organizing committee believes our event
  should reflect and model the values of our communities.
  Diversity and inclusivity have rightly risen to prominence
  as major points of concern in both our local community and
  the broader Ruby community.</p>

<h3>How to?</h3>

<p>
  The discount code is "diversity"
  and it will save you $100 off of a full-priced ticket.
  You can enter it on the page as you buy your ticket.</p>

<p>
  The choice of a discount code reflects the nature of this year's experiment
  to sell tickets to the conference in three weekly batches.
  In past years, tickets have sold out so quickly
  that some have missed the opportunity to buy.
  This particularly impacted those people
  who were not immediately sure that they were able to attend.</p>

<p>
  Using a code allows those who identify as underrepresented in our community
  to take advantage of the discount at any time.</p>

<p>
  While we are not defining "underrepresented," the intent of the discount is
  to help people out who might otherwise
  have trouble paying full-price for the conference themselves.
  Therefore we ask that those attendees whose employers typically pay
  for conferences and training not use the discount
  so we can make sure that the discount go to those people who most need it.</p>

<p>
  By pairing our staggered ticket release with our discount code,
  we are hoping to reach a broader group of attendees
  who might otherwise have missed the ticketing rush
  by allowing those who identify as underrepresented in our community
  to take advantage of the discount at any point in our ticketing cycle.</p>
